/*
Find Closest Value in BST
You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes. 
Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes
stored in properties called "left" and "right", respectively.
A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property:
its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; 
its value os less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its children nodes are 
either BST nodes or None values. You are also given a target int value;
write a function that finds the closest value to that target value contained in BST.
Assume that there will only be one closest value.
